 Day 1 Assignment: Arrays and Strings (Java)
 Section A: Arrays
 
What is an array? Explain the difference between 1D array and 2D array with examples.
 
Write a Java program to create a 1D array and traverse its elements.
 
Write a Java program to create a 2D array and display it in matrix format.
 
Write a program to insert an element at a given position in an array.
 
Write a program to delete an element from a given position in an array.
 
Write a Java program to find the largest and smallest element in an array.
 
Write a program to rotate the elements of an array to the left by d positions.
 
Given a sorted array, write a program to remove duplicate elements and print the updated array.
 
Section B: Strings
 
What is a String in Java? Explain String immutability.
 
Write a Java program to perform basic string manipulations:
 
Find length of the string
 
Convert to uppercase and lowercase
 
Extract a substring
 
Write a program to check whether a given string is a binary string (contains only 0 and 1).
 
Explain the difference between substring and subsequence with examples.
 
Write a Java program to search for a pattern in a given string.
 
Write a Java program to check whether a given string is a palindrome.
 
Section C: Conceptual Questions
 
What happens if we try to access an array index out of bounds?
 
What is the time complexity of array traversal?
 
Why are arrays called fixed-size data structures?
